# djmapBx

> A Vue.js project

- Using Vuex for state management
- Using Vuetify for prebuilt reusable components with styling
- Using material-design-icons-iconfont for nice little icons
- Using vue-router routing though there is only one route
- Using webpack for bundling
- Using jest for unit testing, no tests created
- Using nightwatch for end-to-end testing, no tests created
- Using MapBox_GL for maps
- Using Leaflet as a map plugin

- You will need a mapbox access token
- https://www.mapbox.com/help/glossary/access-token/
- Once you have one navigate to /config/dev.env.js and add it as MAP_KEY: blablabla
- also note that it will begin with the letters "pk"
- Navigate to /map to see the map

- I followed the quickstart tutorial:
- https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/

- Would use Axios for api calls, however have not brought it in because there is no backend.
