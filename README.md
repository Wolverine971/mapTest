> A Vue.js project

Using Vuex for state management
Using Vuetify for prebuilt reusable components with styling
Using material-design-icons-iconfont for nice little icons
Using vue-router routing though there is only one route
Using webpack for bundling
Using jest for unit testing, no tests created
Using nightwatch for end-to-end testing, no tests created

Would use Axios for api calls, however have not brought it in because there is no backend.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
